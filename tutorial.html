		An intro to Hex
	</p>
</div>
<div id="content">
	<p><a href="https://github.com/cowpig/hex">Hex</a> is so called because it is played on a hexagonal grid, like this one:
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
	Note how the hexagons have coordinates, starting from (0,0) in the top-left, with the first number indicating the x-coordinate, or column number, and the second number indicating the y-coordinate, or row number. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In Hex, the map loops around in every direction, so going north-west from the hexagon at (2,0) results in landing on (1,3).
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
	The game, however, isn't played on a full block of hexagons. A new map is randomly generated each game, along with the home spaces for each player.
	</p>

	</p>
	<p>
	Each player also has pieces. The pieces vary in range and vision. Below, player A has two pieces. The piece marked by a "1" can move once in any direction, as the blue highlight around it shows. Similarly, the two can move two hexagons in any direction.
	</p>

	</p>
	<p>
	A piece can also move on top of another piece. If it is an enemy piece, it will capture that piece, just like in chess. If it moves on top of a frienly piece, however, the pieces combine to form a new piece with the sum of the constituent pieces' ranges.
	</p>

		</center>
	</p>
	<p>
	The newly created piece has a range of 3, which is enough to reach the enemy home and win the game.
