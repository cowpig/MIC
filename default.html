		The Machine Intelligence Cup is a competition that will be held in the summer of 2014 in Montreal, QC. It will consist of a game, called <a href="https://github.com/cowpig/hex">Hex</a>, for which participants will write artificial players. The programs written by participants will then play each other, recieve rankings, and the top players will compete at an event, with the final games displayed on a screen in front of a live audience!
	</p>

	<p>
		The back-end of the game is complete, and a preliminary GUI has been written. <a href="tutorial.html">Here is a quick tutorial</a> explaining the basics of how it works.
	</p>

	<p>
		Below is a demo of the game, using the some copy/pasted output from the back end into the latest iteration of the front end. In this game, the players played according to the following logic:
		<ul>
			<li>
				If the enemy base is in sight, attack it
			</li>
			<li>
				Otherwise, choose a move at random
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

			<canvas id="hexCanvas" width="700" height="550" style="width:700px;height:550px">
			</canvas>
		</center>
	</p>

	<p>
		Much work remains to be done, and we could use the help of:
		<ul>
			<li><em>Web designers/developers</em> to work on the <a href="https://github.com/cowpig/MIC">webpage</a></li>
			<li><em>Graphic Designer(s)</em> to create a better logo, promotional material, game pieces, and generally make this thing look good.</li>
			<li><em>JS/Coffeescript Developer(s)</em> to do the GUI/Front end of <a href="https://github.com/cowpig/hex">Hex</a></li>
			<li><em>Backend Developer(s)</em> to do in-game client/server interactions for <a href="https://github.com/cowpig/hex">Hex</a></li>
			<li><em>Backend Developer(s)/Sys admin</em> to set up virtual environments to run participants' code serverside and integrate that output with the game's API</li>
			<li><em>Organizers</em> to speak to venues, prospective sponsors, schools, participants, etc</li>
		</ul>
